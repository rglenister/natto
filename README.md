# **Natto Chess Engine**
**Natto** is a chess engine designed for strong positional and tactical play, supporting advanced features like transposition tables, iterative deepening, and move ordering. It is designed to be compatible with UCI (Universal Chess Interface) and can be used with popular chess GUIs like [Arena](http://playwitharena.de/), [ChessBase](https://en.chessbase.com/), or [CuteChess](https://github.com/cutechess/cutechess).
## **Features**
- Advanced search algorithms (Negamax, Alpha-Beta pruning, Quiescence search)
- Transposition table with customizable memory size
- Supports threefold repetition, 50-move rule, and stalemate detection
- Import/export of FEN formats
- Configurable thread usage for parallelism of the perft performance test
- Supports the Lichess opening database

## **Requirements**
Ensure you have the following installed:
1. **Rust Toolchain**: [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
``` bash
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```
1. **Chess GUI**: Any UCI-compatible interface (e.g., Arena, ChessBase, CuteChess).
2. **Environment Configuration**: file or command-line arguments.

## **Setup**
Clone the repository and install dependencies:
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/rglenister/natto
cd natto
cargo build --release
```
Please note that the --release flag is required for building because the executable file it produces is
then fully optimized for speed. 
## **Configuration**
Natto can be configured using a file or via command-line arguments. All configuration items are optional. 
Hereâ€™s a list of key configuration options:
### **1. Environment Variables**
Create a file named `.env` in the project root to customize settings: 
``` env
# Logging Configuration
NATTO_LOG_FILE=/absolute/path/to/natto.log # Path to the log file
NATTO_LOG_LEVEL=debug                      # Log levels: trace, debug, info, warn, error

# Search Configuration
NATTO_HASH_SIZE=512                        # Transposition table size (must be power-of-two, in MB)
RAYON_NUM_THREADS=4                        # Number of threads to use for parallelism in the perft performance test 

# Opening Book
NATTO_OWN_BOOK=true                        # Enable or disable internal opening book
NATTO_BOOK_DEPTH=10                        # Depth of moves to consider from the opening book
```
### **2. Command-Line Arguments**
You can override settings using the following command-line flags:

| Flag           | Description                                        | Default Value |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| `--log-file`   | Path to your log file                              | `./natto.log` |
| `--log-level`  | Log verbosity                                      | `info`        |
| `--own-book`   | Use the engine's internal opening book             | `false`       |
| `--book-depth` | The maximum move number that uses the opening book | `10`          |
| `--hash-size`  | Size of the transposition table in megabytes       | `256`         |
| `--perft`      | Flag that runs the performance test                | `false`       |
| `--uci`        | Run comma separated UCI protocol commands      | N/A           |
| `--help`       | Show help                                      | `false`       |
| `--version`    | Flag that displays the application version         | `false`       |

Example:
``` bash
RUST_LOG=debug cargo run --release -- --hash-size 512 --log-level error
```
To run the performance test:
``` bash
cargo run --release -- --perft
```
## **Running the Engine**
### **1. Directly from Command Line**
To start the chess engine directly without cargo:
``` bash
./natto
```
This will initialize the engine in UCI mode, which can be used by any UCI-compatible GUI. Note that the --release flag
is not required when running the application directly.
### **2. Integrate with a Chess GUI**
1. **Arena GUI**:
    - Open Arena, navigate to `Engines > Install New Engine`.
    - Select the compiled binary (`target/release/natto`).
    - Configure custom arguments and options in Arena's settings.

2. **CuteChess**:
    - Add Natto as a new UCI engine in the GUI configuration.
    - Ensure it points to the executable (`target/release/natto`).

3. **ChessBase**:
    - Add Natto as a UCI engine in `Engine > Create UCI Engine`.

Further configuration options are available within these GUIs:

| Option           | Description                                        |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `debug log file` | The path to a further log file                     |
| `hash`           | Hash table size in megabytes                       |
| `ownbook`        | Use the engine's internal opening book             |
| `bookdepth`      | The maximum move number that uses the opening book |

All of these except for the debug log file option simply override the corresponding command line options / environment variables.

## **Logging**
Logs provide helpful details about engine behavior, moves searched, and debugging information. By default, logs are stored in the processes current working directory. You can customize the path and verbosity using:
``` env
NATTO_LOG_FILE=/path/to/natto.log
NATTO_LOG_LEVEL=debug
```
Or override at runtime:
``` bash
RUST_LOG=trace cargo run --release
```
The logging is also sent to the console. The standard error stream is used due to the standard output stream being
used by the UCI protocol. To see the UCI protocol in action without the logging this output can be
prevented by redirecting the error stream to a null file e.g for UNIX add `2> /dev/null` to the command line
or `2>nul` for Windows.
Alternatively setting the logging level to `error` will cause only errors to be logged.
## **Tests**
The project includes a series of tests to verify engine correctness:
1. Run all tests:
``` bash
   cargo test --release -- --test-threads=1
```
1. Run specific tests:
``` bash
   cargo test --release test_mate_in_three
```
